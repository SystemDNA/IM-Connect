                <h6 class="title">Navigating the Luxu.ry Yacht Market</h6>
                <p>At some point in their wealth journey, many ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families often consider expanding and diversifying their portfolios to include luxury and non-standard assets.</p>
                <p>For some, this might mean investing in art collections, antiquities, jewelery- even fine wine which, traditionally considered more of a niche' investment, is increasingly becoming a mainstream alternative asset.</p>
                <p>For those looking to gratify an adventurous spirit, however, the addition of a yacht to an investment portfolio provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore vast oceans and hidden paradises, coupled with the satisfaction of owning a remarkable, tangible asset.</p>
                <p>In fact, recent forecasts show it is full steam ahead for the luxury yacht market, with global luxury yacht market revenue expected to be worth USD 8,812.4 million by the end of 2023, and an enormous USD 19,924.7 million by 2033.</p>
                <p><b>Streamlining the process</b></p>
                <p>It isn't all plain sailing, though. Owning an impressive and significant luxury asset such as a yacht comes too with commensurate administrative, legal and financial considerations.</p>
                <p>The administrative demands of yacht management can be a burdensome tether to those searching for the freedom of the open ocean, and engaging the services of a yacht management provider will be an essential first step when purchasing a vessel.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Vessel registration procedures, flagging, maritime regulations and tax implications (to name a few) can vary enormously between jurisdictions and the management services provider can help tailor the approach as appropriate to the chosen location.</p>
                <p>Put simply, an appropriate yacht management expert will free up the owner to enjoy their investment, including taking on responsibility for Day to day' operational requirements such as crew staffing, recruitment and visa applications, pay and logistical coordination.</p>
                <p><b>Location, location, location...</b></p>
                <p>As outlined above, the jurisdiction in which the vessel is registered can have huge legal, financial and operational implications and there are a number of factors that need to be taken into account.</p>
                <p>Firstly, each flag state will have its own set of maritime laws and regulations and it is important to make sure these align with the intended use of the vessel. Choosing a politically stable country with a long-standing reputation of maritime excellence - such as Cayman, for instance - can be of enormous value both financially and practically, depending on the intended use of the yacht.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p-3 bg-black text-light clearfix">
                <img src="images/yachting/yachting1.jpg" class="rounded float-start me-3 mb-3" alt="..." style="max-width: 50%;">
                <p>It is also prudent to seek advice on the varying tax requirements and implications including VAT, import duties, annual tax etc... as some jurisdictions will offer far more favorable tax conditions. Yacht owners and their advisers should also look to answer questions such as how easy the yacht registration process is in their chosen jurisdiction, whether there are any specific crew requirements imposed in that country, how easy it is to take out an insurance policy on a vessel registered under a particular flag etc.</p>
                <p>The above are just a few of the vitally important considerations to evaluate before making a decision, but the full list of crosschecks is extensive. Even the size of the vessel will influence where a yacht can be registered - in some countries larger yachts may need to comply with additional safety and certification requirements. Longer vessels may also be prevented from docking in certain cities as was seen recently with Naples introducing a strict 75 meter length limit for yachts looking to dock in Italy's third-largest city, to the chagrin of many wealthy owners.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container bg-white clearfix">
                <h6 class="title">Ownership structures: charting the right course</h6>
                <img src="~/images/yachting/yachting2.png" class="img-thumbnail rounded float-end ms-3" alt="..." style="max-width: 50%;max-height: 200px;">
                <p>The ownership structure of the yacht is another important aspect to get right. Holding the yacht in an appropriate legal structure - such as a trust - can provide significant benefits as compared to owning the vessel as an individual.</p>
                <p>Trusts, for instance, have evolved as an estate-planning tool that can help families build and preserve generational wealth (and help break the so-called "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves" curse).</p>
                <p>Placing the yacht in a trust can make it much simpler to establish clear instructions for the management and transfer of the vessel to beneficiaries after the owner's passing. A proactive approach to estate planning can help avoid potential disputes among family members later down the line, and help ensure the continued upkeep and enjoyment of the yacht.</p>
                <p>Assets transferred to a trust are also (depending on the type of trust) no longer considered to form part of the settlor's property. The trust acts as a separate legal entity, ring-fencing the yacht's ownership from the personal and business liabilities of the owner. Placing a yacht in a trust can therefore provide an enhanced level of asset protection, reducing the risk of the vessel being seized - including as a result of a contentious legal scenario such bankruptcy or divorce.</p>
                <p>
                    Engaging the appropriate advisors early on in the acquisition process and seeking counsel on the most effective structure for holding assets according to individual requirements and preferences is crucial when looking at purchasing any luxury asset, especially a yacht.

                                <p>The interiors mood can be defined as "sporty luxury", according to the exteriors lines. The style is precise, well defined and organically applied to the whole, which thus becomes a single whole, becoming a luxurious and very cool shell, always without missing elegance and refinement. The key point is the contrast between smooth finishes, such as leathers and Alcantara, and more materic ones such as metallic surfaces and sculptural volumes. Noble metals are a strong theme in these interiors: bronze, platinum and gold are used to enhance the luxury feel contrasting the softness of the neutral colour palette. The materials used are the result of a careful research and a great craftsmanship, that necessary for their creation and application on complex surfaces and detailing. Sophistication comes more from substance than decoration, the value is inherent in the used materials themselves.</p>

                <p>As Breguet prepares to mark a notable anniversary we take a look at one of its most spectacular and innovative pieces the Marine Tourbillon Équation Marchante 5887</p>
                <p>The year 2021 might be notable for many reasons, but in watchmaking terms it is honorably distinguished as the 220th anniversary of the tourbillon, an invention patented by Abraham-Louis Breguet on 26 June 1801.</p>
                <p>Breguet plans to release a commemorative model this autumn, something we are very much looking forward to. But while we are waiting, it is worth noting that the brand at the pinnacle of the Swatch Group pyramid has never ceased to celebrate its traditions, creating watches that pay homage to the past while being reinforced by the latest technologies.</p>
                <p>Last year in particular, the stunning Double Tourbillon Quai de l'Horloge from the Classique collection delighted collectors, while the Marine line evokes the triple his- torical expertise of the brand founder expressed through a more contemporary, slimmer and more efficient interpretation.</p>

                <p>Always intrinsically linked to the tourbillon, Breguet offers a reminder through this Marine model that its inventor was also appointed official watchmaker to the French Royal Navy. As such, sophisticated horological complications such as the perpetual calendar and the equation of time hold no secrets for the venerable brand.</p>
                <p>Derived from the ultra-thin self-winding Caliber 581 equipped with a tourbillon, this movement features an optimized design incorporating recent innovations such as a titanium carriage with a peripheral gear wheel driving its rota- tion, as well as a silicon balance-spring and escape-wheel.</p>
                <p>Similarly, Breguet's designers have achieved a one-quarter reduction in the barrel thickness by cutting a groove around the drum and holding it in place by means of three externally placed bearings.</p>
                <div class="image-container mb-3 rounded" style="padding-top: 50%;">

                <p>Connoisseurs will recognize the function of the hand tipped with a sun, indicating the minutes of solar time (different from the minutes of civil time driven by the main gear train) thanks to differential gearing and a cam on a sapphire disk performing one revolution in a year, followed by a feeler that provides the value of the equation of time.</p>
                <p>As for the anchor-tipped hand, it provides a retrograde date display. So as to improve the legibility of all these indications, Breguet completes the perpetual calendar indications by apertures showing the day and month, which are unique in its collections. </p>
                <p>The power reserve is discreetly shown on an arc-shaped gauge at 8 o'clock. All this information is easily readable on the attractive anthracite dial featuring white and gold contrasts, above which the majestic tourbillon appears to be floating in mid-air.</p>
